### The work so far...
I have created an icosahedron and almost finished my work with the sphere. I recieved some help from Sam Gauck about my calculations regarding the width of each ring. 

I have had some trouble figuring out how to calculate the x&y of the ring. It has largely been fixed, due to actually adding trig functions to do the math needed (that is where Sam assisted).

As it currently stands, the sphere is functional, but you will notice the parity is flipped across the x-axis.

I am preparing to begin work on the torus (and then after that the revolution).
