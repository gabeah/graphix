### The work so far...
I have created an icosahedron and almost finished my work with the sphere. I recieved some help from Sam Gauck about my calculations regarding the width of each ring. 

I have had some trouble figuring out how to calculate the x&y of the ring. It has largely been fixed, due to actually adding trig functions to do the math needed (that is where Sam assisted). I still am figuring out how to make the top and bottom, currently the triangles extend too far beyond the sphere, making it look like a plump tie-fighter.

I am preparing to begin work on the torus
