### The work so far...
I have created an icosahedron and almost finished my work with the sphere. I recieved some help from Sam Gauck about my calculations regarding the width of each ring. 

I have had some trouble figuring out how to calculate the x&y of the ring. It has largely been fixed, due to actually adding trig functions to do the math needed (that is where Sam assisted).

For the torus and revolution, I also struggled a lot with figuring out how to do transformations between the various points. I got some help from Zeke who helped me get those ratios down.

I plan to resubmit this later today (9/19) with better code comments, a GL slider, and also some prettier shapes to revolve around.
