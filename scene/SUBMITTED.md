# Project 2 - Make a Scene

I will specify the line range for each section of the project. Some of the pre-existing code has been deleted to keep my contributions all in one place.

## 2D Scene
### Lines 201 - 350
I decided to make waves (literally) in the scene. I attempted to create a periscope that could be controlled by the slider below. You can also click and drag the waves around.

## Recursive Snowflake
### Lines 351 - 398
I created a Sierpinski Hexagon. In all honesty, I'm suprised it worked almost first try. There is currently a bug where for when the slider is set to zero. The fix is having the slider start at 1.

## Still Life
### Lines 698 - 1010 (I cut out the table/wall/light making cause I did not actively write that code)
This is relatively straightforward. It looks like there was a `createTable()` function hiding in the code. I'm not sure if that was intentional, but I am using it to create the table in the project.

The objects are sitting comfortably on it, I'm not sure if they are interfacing with the lighting correctly, but I think it is also due to the wild color scheme I have set.

## Animation
### Lines 1079 - ...
As of writing, this is currently in progress, the project may be submitted before I complete the animation component.
