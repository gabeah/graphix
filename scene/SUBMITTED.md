# Project 2 - Make a Scene

## The progress so far...
I have almost finished the first part of the project. I decided to make waves (literally) in the scene.

I plan to add a little boat and then continue on to the next part. The waves will follow the mouse cursor.

I haven't run into gigantic issues just yet, mainly because doing transformations works easier in my brain than defining specific triangles. I'm sure that will cause issues in the animation.
