## Project 5 - Bezier Funhouse
### Gabe Howland

So far I have written code for the Bezier interpolation. I found that if I use `1/SMOOTHNESS` as a metric for whether we are done interpolating as opposed to `EPSILON`, the curve does not meet the first and third control points.

My next step is to create the mirror with a diffuse surface before tackling a mirrored one. The success of which (before tomorrow at 10:30am) will be reported below.

"Did not make any significant progress."
